			"raw": "\nWe’ve got notes on this week’s release. Would you like to read them?\n\nEverything mentioned here will land in [our SDK](https://tldraw.dev/) next week but you can try them out right now on [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com/). Let’s look at what’s new, what’s changed, and what’s fixed.\n\n## What’s new\n\nWe added a **new label** alignment option to the style panel, so you can now control the alignment of text and shape labels separately.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2e6f5eb-3095-471d-bc98-d7bc2dd83c9a_720x406.gif)\n\nYou can have your text aligned one way, and your labels aligned a different way. And **text is now left-aligned by default**!\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedf128cb-9dcd-4c0b-932b-c57d2dbc4e7d_720x406.gif)\n\nOur **minimap is now much faster** and more reliable, even on tablets and phones.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe02b6d9e-7dc4-4046-b8b2-d81fc4b04ff2_960x542.gif)\n\n**We’ve added support for Desmos embeds** in the editor. Paste your graph’s URL and we’ll create an interactive shape on the canvas. Thanks to GitHub user \"not-first\" for the contribution.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F925bcdc0-048a-458a-b0d6-f428fd1a327e_960x542.gif)\n\nYou can now **embed tldraw inside of iframes**. Paste a multiplayer tldraw link into an app like Notion and you’ll again have the chance to interact with the canvas.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfca0d24-625a-4581-b1d7-676aa3ac7e8b_960x540.gif)\n\n## One neat trick\n\n_Here’s **one neat trick** (segment back by popular demand)._\n\nIn tldraw, you can create two different types of text.\n\n1. Pick the text tool and **click** to create some automatically sized text. It will grow as you type more into it.\n2. Or **click and drag** to create some text with a fixed size. It wraps your writing over multiple lines.\n\nTo change fixed sized text back to automatic, double-click on the left or right-hand edge.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6147bc4-7048-462d-8f21-3d0dc028ddee_960x540.gif)\n\n## Improvements\n\nWhen you’re zoomed out a long way, we now only show **one** handle on note shapes. This makes it easier to grab them without accidentally pulling on a handle.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68d1b8c0-879d-44d0-9dd8-ce1b63cd0af3_960x542.gif)\n\nDid you know you can use tldraw with pressure-sensitive devices like iPad pencils and Wacom tablets? We now **more accurately detect devices with pressure** and assign the right digital ink options, even if your device isn’t technically a pen.\n\nSpeaking of ink, we’ve followed up on last release’s performance improvements with another set of **improvements to freehand lines**.\n\nWe’ve also updated our translations. French and Korean saw some big updates, and tldraw now supports Indonesian! Thank you to Muhajayaanwar, Benchekroun Mohamed Badr, Cyberuls, and Sabri Eddir for the contributions.\n\n## Fixes\n\n- Fixed a bug where tldraw could [infinitely nest](https://twitter.com/TodePond/status/1785258740565848340) inside itself.\n- Embed shapes can now link back to their own site.\n- Fixed error sound when copying on Safari.\n- Fixed alignment of board title.\n- Fixed sticky notes aligning incorrectly.\n- Fixed paste not working from the Edit menu on Safari.\n- And fixed text resizing while holding the alt key.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3974866-f1ea-4efb-95b7-8e3c1741dcb7_722x404.gif)\n\n---\n\nAs always, try out the changes on [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com/) and let us know what you think.
