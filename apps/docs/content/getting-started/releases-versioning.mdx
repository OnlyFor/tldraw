## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Here's what we do instead:

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

## Current release: [v3.1.0](/releases/v3.1.0)

Welcome to the 3.1.0 release of the tldraw SDK. This is a small release including a couple of new features, a couple of API additions, and some bug fixes.

Special thanks to new contributor Peter Hagen ([@phgn0](https://github.com/phgn0))!

## What's new

### Hiding shapes using the `isShapeHidden` option

There are some cases where it is useful to prevent shapes from being visible or interactive, e.g. to implement simple permissions in a collaborative app.

You can now use the `isShapeHidden` predicate option to prevent shapes from being rendered or from reacting to pointer events. Learn more in the [docs](https://tldraw.dev/docs/editor#Hiding-shapes).

### Directly update data on the tldraw sync server

If you're using [tldraw sync](https://staging.tldraw.dev/docs/sync) for your app, it is now possible to manipulate document data directly on the server using the `updateShapes` method. This can be useful for integrating features with third-party services, e.g. updating a video shape after your CDN has finished processing it.

## Breaking Changes

- No breaking changes!

## API Changes

- Add an option to `Editor.rotateShapesBy` to allow specifying the rotation center point. ([#4508](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4508))
- Publish the `useAsset` hook for resolving responsive versions of assets. ([#4590](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4590))

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug with arrow label text measurements. ([#4571](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4571))
- Fixed an issue with arrow collaborator indicator showing on top of the arrow's label. ([#4580](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4580))
- Fix an unhandled error related to processing bindings. ([#4506](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4506))
- Fixed a bug with the watermark's opacities and animations. ([#4589](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4589))
