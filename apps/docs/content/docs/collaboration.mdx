The tldraw SDK includes deep support for real-time collaboration. The easiest way to add collaboration to your project is through our [tldraw sync](#tldraw-sync) library. If you prefer to use something else, you can integrate [other backends](#Using-other-backends) using our other public APIs.

## tldraw sync

tldraw sync is a library for fast, multiuser collaboration. It's purpose-built for the tldraw canvas, and is in use on our flagship app tldraw.com to power the shared whiteboards there.

			WebkitMask: 'url(/images/multiplayer_mask.png) luminance center 100% / 100% no-repeat',
		}}
	/>

### Using the tldraw sync demo

To make it easier to get started, we've included a "demo" hook in the sync library that connects to a hosted backend. This is just a demo: we delete all files and assets created with this backend every 24 hours. If you want to use tldraw sync in production, see our guide below.

> You can see a working example at [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/tldraw-sync-demo-d9vq5g?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%3A9%2C50).

Let's say you have an app running locally that looks like this:

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'

function MyApp() {
	return <Tldraw />
}
```

To make this app collaborative, first install the `@tldraw/sync` library:

```bash
npm install @tldraw/sync
```

Back in your code, import the `useSyncDemo` hook from the `@tldraw/sync` library. In the `MyApp` component, call the `useSyncDemo` hook with a room ID. (Note that anyone using the same room ID will be accessing the same file, so pick a unique one.) Pass the [`store`](/docs/persistence#The-store-prop) returned by `useSyncDemo` to the tldraw component's `store` prop.

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'
import { useSyncDemo } from '@tldraw/sync'

function MyApp() {
	const store = useSyncDemo({ roomId: 'my-unique-room-id' })
	return <Tldraw store={store} />
}
```

In your browser, open an incognito window and visit your project's URL. You can also use a different browser or different device. The key is the room ID: any apps connecting to the same room ID will enter into a shared collaboration session.

### Using tldraw sync in production

To use tldraw sync in production, you will need to self-host the tldraw sync server. (We don't offer a hosted solution for tldraw sync, but if you're interested in that please let us know at hello@tldraw.com).

You will need to:

1. Host the tldraw sync server code, which serves the room over [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).
2. Configure a storage solution (e.g. a bucket) to store images, videos, and other user-created assets.
3. Connect to the server with the [`useSync`](?) hook.

#### Backend

The `@tldraw/sync` package includes everything you need to self-host tldraw sync. You can host the server anywhere and use whichever storage solution you like, so long as the client can connect to it.

We've created a [Cloudflare Workers template](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-sync-cloudflare) that you can use as a starting point or reference. This example is a simplification of the system that we use to power multiplayer collaboration on tldraw.com. It includes the sync server hosted by Cloudflare Workers, asset hosting through Cloudflare's R2 buckets, and some handlers for a few other server-side tasks.

### Connect to your client

Once you have your server set up, use the [`useSync`](?) hook from `@tldraw/sync` to connect your backend to the tldraw editor. Call the hook to create a store, then pass it in to the `<Tldraw />` component:

```tsx
import {useSync} from '@tldraw/sync'

const myAssetStore: TLAssetStore {
	upload(file, asset) {
		return uploadFileAndReturnUrl(file)
	},
	resolve(asset) {
		return asset.props.src
	},
}

function MyApp() {
	const store = useSync({
		uri: 'https://yourapp.com/<PATH TO YOUR ROOM>',
		assets: myAssetStore,
	})

	return <Tldraw store={store} />
}

```

You can see a complete example using the sync client in the [`tldraw-sync-cloudflare`](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/templates/sync-cloudflare/client/App.tsx) template.

## Collaboration UI

The `tldraw` library includes several components specifically designed for collaboration.

- Collaborator cursors: [`TLComponents#CollaboratorCursor`](?)
- Cursor chat: [`TLComponents#CursorChatBubble`](?)
- Offline indicator: [`TLComponents#TopPanel`](?)
- Collaborator list: [`TLComponents#SharePanel`](?)

The `@tldraw/sync` client automatically enables some default collaborative UX, but you can remove, replace, or customize these using the editor's components prop. See [TLComponents](?) for more info.

## Using other backends

While tldraw sync is our recommended and best-supported backend for tldraw, we designed the SDK to work with any data solution. If you cannot use tldraw sync, or if you have an existing real-time collaboration solution that you prefer to use instead, you can integrate it with tldraw using our public APIs.

As a reference, see our [tldraw-yjs example](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-yjs-example) that shows an integration between tldraw and the [Yjs](https://yjs.dev) CRDT library. If you are connecting a different backend, you will likely follow similar patterns.

If you're interested in building a custom solution, we also have a [simple Node/Bun server example](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/apps/simple-server-example) showing how to use some of the lower-level APIs directly.

For information about how to synchronize the store with other processes, i.e. how to get data out and put data in, including from remote sources, see the [Persistence](/docs/persistence) page.
